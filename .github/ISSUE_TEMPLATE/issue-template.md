Remember, the GitHub Issue Tracker is not the place to ask for support or to submit game compatibility https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/blob/master/README.md reports.
You must use our forum on Discord https://discord.gg/26Xjx23 for that.
Otherwise, for any other emulation/general issues like crashes when a controller is connected, or regressions across several titles, feel free to report your issue here.
